####Tips on naming your pages

I'm going to build a new page underneath about webcom
now let's go up to new page you're going to see a title and
a name field your title refers to you your navigation title see you want to make sure that this is case sensitive in this case
we're just going to call this test page the name is what appears in the URL if you leave a name field blank
the CMS what automatically create a URL based on your page
title.
if you want to fill in the Name field yourself make sure it is  always lower case as lower case URL's are web standard next we're going to find our template. if you forgot the template you are using for your website just refer to the template column here in your website list in this case I'll be using the
department or content template.

 

 
once I selected my template I can hit create you're going to see a new page ball and Ernie about webcom and you can see
the URL is created with the dash in between each up the title words now we're gonna open up the new page that we created
by double-clicking this will open the page in at Malad so we can add content to the page you'll notice that the page opens in a new tab I find it convenient because my site admin
screen is always open and I can have multiple pages open and edit mode what's but you may find you like the page to open in the same tab better.

to change just feature simply go

back to your admin screen

click on your username and go to


preferences you can see in  management you can say multiple windows or single Windows in edit mode you'll see your page is broken up into different blocks of content. you'll see the Sidekick whichyou can take and drag around and if I open up my sidebar which you can hide and expand this is the way that you can at content which will go over later in our next training
